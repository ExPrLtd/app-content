<h1>What are Talking Apps?</h1>
<p class-"intro">When we talk about Talking apps, we&rsquo;re referring to Augmentative Alternative Communication (AAC) tools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Historically, when kids were not yet talking, we used picture icons or laminated words that could be used to build statements and requests for children and adults who did not have vocal communication, or maybe needed some prompting, to help organize their words.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These laminated words or pictures were usually kept in a small binder a child would carry around with them. Today we have cool apps for this, like Proloqou2go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Essentially, those icons we used for years in laminated books are now available in an app for tablets and smartphones.</p>
<h1>When are they appropriate? For whom?</h1>
<p>Discussing the topic of AAC tools may be a bit premature for most Happy Ladders toddlers. It is best to discuss this with your child&rsquo;s speech therapist first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, kids need to be a bit older to use the technology and with toddlers who spend most of their time at home, using actual pictures around the house (in the pantry, on the toy shelf, etc&hellip;) to help label items, may be best.</p>
<h1>Will AAC replace my child&rsquo;s vocal speech?</h1>
<p>The short answer is No. Many parents do worry that getting an AAC device or using pictures, will hinder their child&rsquo;s ability to speak vocally. It is an understandable concern. If anything, AAC devices can actually help promote vocal language over time through modeling and organization of words.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, if a child has more to say but they can&rsquo;t, we should not hold out support for them and wait for vocal speech. Effective communication decreases frustration and increases independence. There&rsquo;s really no downside to assisting vocal language with aids.</p>
<p>Happy Ladders Communication lessons can be used with vocal communication, sign language, pictures, and AAC tools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have more questions, feel free to leave them in the lesson comments, start a topic in the Community or bring them to weekly Office Hours.</p>
