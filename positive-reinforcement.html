<p class="lead">Let&rsquo;s talk about Reinforcement. It&rsquo;s pretty powerful stuff and super helpful when teaching anyone new skills, especially children with developmental needs.</p>
<p>The technical principles of Reinforcement can get pretty technical, and there can be lots of graphs, data, and fancy reinforcement schedules.</p>
<p>For the purpose of the Happy Ladders program, you only need to know a few basics to get started.</p>
<h1>Types of Reinforcers</h1>
<h2>Social Praise</h2>
<p>Examples of social praise&nbsp; include clapping when your child does well, saying &ldquo;Great job!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Awesome, Sarah!&rdquo;&nbsp; Social praise can be extremely powerful for some kids and can help motivate them to do many skills. You may need to experiment to see what types of praise your child responds to most.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep in mind that some kids don&rsquo;t prefer or immediately respond to social praise. You may need to watch your volume or avoid touching them if that is too overwhelming. Give yourself some grace here as you figure this out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even when using a toy, activity or treat as a reinforcer, ALWAYS pair them with social praise. This will help you fade the toy or activity later as your child becomes reinforced enough by the social praise alone.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Toys or Activities</h2>
<p>Examples of using toys and activities as reinforcers could be pushing your child on a swing, tickling them, giving them pieces of a favorite toy, or maybe even access to a cool sensory item.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Food</h2>
<p>Try and always use food as a natural reinforcer when your child requests it; giving food for other activities like completing a puzzle is kind of arbitrary; instead, we want the activity itself to be the reinforcer whenever possible. You&rsquo;ll see how we embed this idea into the Happy Ladders lessons.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>When to Reinforce, Order is Key!</h2>
<p>It is imperative that reinforcers come AFTER the behavior, or in this case, the target skill. If the reinforcer is given prior to your child doing the target skill, it looks more like a bribe, and your child may not engage in the skill but still get reinforced.</p>
<p>This can seem obvious, but trust me when you are really wanting your child to perform a certain skill, it is easy to get caught bribing them by offering the reinforcer before the skill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just think if your boss paid you before your work was due. Do you think you would be as concerned to get it in on time or deliver it with the same quality than if you were paid after?</p>
<h2>Timing/Immediacy</h2>
<p>For young children, reinforcers need to be immediate. If reinforcers do not follow the desired skill immediately after it occurs, children may not understand what is being reinforced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over time, with the successful pairing of the skill and the reinforcer, the skills you are teaching will increase!</p>
<h2>Size</h2>
<p>Like Goldilocks, reinforcers need to be just right, not too much and not too little. Just enough to keep your child wanting more but not so much that they lose interest in the reinforcer and the activity.</p>
<p>Often with new and big skills, say first words, a large reinforcer might be called for, say a full cookie and a family-sized&nbsp; &ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; However, most of the time, little amounts of a reinforcer, say the next puzzle piece, tickles, or a block to build, are just right.</p>
<h2>Appropriate</h2>
<p>Reinforcers are most powerful when they are related to the activity or skill you are teaching.</p>
<p>Giving a cookie for putting on shoes? Not really related. Going outside after putting on shoes makes much more sense!</p>
<p>Reinforcers that have meaning to your child will also accelerate their learning.</p>
<h2>Built-In Reinforcement</h2>
<p>Happy Ladders lessons were designed with built-in reinforcement, so the most you should usually need besides the lesson materials is your social praise and encouragement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using natural reinforcers, the next puzzle piece, a trip outside, or turning the page of a book, your child will also learn the power of their independence and how things in their environment change to their advantage with their actions and communication.</p>
<p>So that was a lot of information! As with most of our Resources, some of this will take a while to fully understand or to fully understand how it applies to working with your child.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Revisit these resources as you need. Over time, they should make more and more sense.</p>
<p>So give it a shot and see what you got!</p>
