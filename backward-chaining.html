<p class="lead">Backward Chaining is a super trick in the ABA backpack. It can be generalized to teaching all sorts of skills, but we will apply them to Self-Help skills here.</p>
<p>Backward Chaining is when you take a skill and break it into small steps.</p>
<p>For instance, let&rsquo;s take putting on a velcro shoe. The steps are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick up shoe</li>
<li>Loosen velcro</li>
<li>Hold shoe open</li>
<li>Put foot in</li>
<li>Pull up tongue of shoe (frankly few kids do this or do it well, so don&rsquo;t sweat it much)</li>
<li>Pull velcro strap(s) tight</li>
<li>Lay velcro strap(s) over shoe</li>
<li>Voila! Shoe is on!</li>
</ol>
<p>So, we can teach these steps in order from 1-7 and fade our prompting from the first step to the second and so forth OR we can use Backward Chaining.</p>
<p>With a backward chain, you do the first steps for your child and you start to fade your prompts at Step #7 (see the Prompt Hierarchy), then fade prompting for Step #6, Step #5, and so on.</p>
<p>Essentially you fade your prompts from end to beginning.</p>
<p>One advantage of Backward Chaining is repeated exposure to the set of steps while you model them correctly. Parents can also label each step as they go. Another advantage is your child gets to work off your momentum and end on independence and success!</p>
<p>So give it a shot and see what you&rsquo;ve got!</p>
