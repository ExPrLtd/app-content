<p class="lead">At the core of ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis) is the Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence model. It's widely used to identify behaviors that occur in excess and are problematic to development or safety.</p>
<p>The Antecedents that occur before the behavior, the description of the Behavior itself and the Consequence, the events that follow the Behavior, are the core tenants.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll apply an easy example to a toddler&rsquo;s tantrum, which is all too familiar for most parents of young children.</p>
<table class="table">
<thead class="thead-dark">
<tr>
<th>Antecedent</th>
<th>Behavior</th>
<th>Consequence</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Child skipped a nap, dinner is not ready and it&rsquo;s getting late</td>
<td>Child whines for a cookie</td>
<td>Mom gives child a cookie</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Child finishes dinner</td>
<td>Mom prompts child to ask for a cookie via sign language</td>
<td>Mom gives child a cookie</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It&rsquo;s rather easy to see in this example that the child will quickly learn that whining for a cookie is the way to go. We also learn that this behavior may be more likely when the child is tired and hungry. Knowing this gives us the option to rearrange antecedents in the future. We can also teach them how to appropriately ask for a cookie (either through gesture, sign, vocal words or even a talking app).</p>
<p>More on this in the future, but I&rsquo;d like to use the ABC model to help you set up your Happy Ladders lessons. Rather than using the Antecedent- Behavior-Consequence for problem behaviors, it can be also used to set up successful learning scenarios.</p>
<p>First, your Antecedent is your set-up, your timing, your goal and the directions you give. You can read<span>&nbsp;</span><i>Setting Your Stage<span>&nbsp;</span></i>for more on this. The Behavior is your child&rsquo;s response. Maybe they say a word, hand you an object or point at a picture. Delivering reinforcement (Consequence) at the right point, in the right amount is key. Whenever possible, we also want the reinforcement to relate to the activity at hand. If you choose activities your child finds enjoyable and insert yourself within the ABC model, you can be the deliverer of the natural reinforcer. The Happy Ladders program was designed to be a play-based approach that capitalizes on your child&rsquo;s interest and natural reinforcement.</p>
<p>Take a look at a few examples&hellip;</p>
<table class="table">
<thead class="thead-dark">
<tr>
<th>Antecedent</th>
<th>Behavior</th>
<th>Consequence</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Mom sets up an inset puzzle activity, she holds the pieces, child gets the board</td>
<td>Child points to desired piece</td>
<td>Mom gives him the piece to place in the board, pairs that with social praise and labels the picture on the puzzle piece (&ldquo;Awesome job, PIG&rdquo;)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dad hides around corner of room from child and calls child&rsquo;s name</td>
<td>Child crawls to Dad</td>
<td>Dad says &ldquo;You found me&rdquo; and tickles child before hiding again</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So take a shot and see what ya&rsquo; got. As you start teaching your child, look to see how your lessons are set up within the Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence model. Alternatively, if you run into behaviors you wish to decrease, use the ABC model to help rearrange the Antecedents and Consequences to provide your child with alternative skills and obtain reinforcement through more positive behaviors.</p>
