<p class="lead">My background is in ABA or Applied Behavior Analysis. Some ABA strategies I have found very helpful in my work with children with developmental needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the core of ABA is the Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence model. It&rsquo;s widely used to identify behaviors that occur in excess and are problematic to development or safety. But really, when you look a little closer we find that virtually all human actions fit the ABC model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ABC stands for Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence</p>
<p>The Antecedents that occur before the behavior, the description of the Behavior itself and the Consequence, which are the events that follow the Behavior.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll apply an easy example to a toddler&rsquo;s tantrum, which is all too familiar for most parents of young children.</p>
<ol>
<li>Antecedent: Child skipped a nap, dinner is not ready and it&rsquo;s getting late</li>
<li>Behavior: Child whines and eventually starts to tantrum for a cookie</li>
<li>Consequence: Mom gives child a cookie</li>
</ol>
<p>It&rsquo;s rather easy to see in this example that the child will quickly learn that whining for a cookie is the way to go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also learn that this behavior may be more likely when the child is tired and hungry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an alternate scenario to teach a more appropriate way to get cookies.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Antecedent: Child finishes dinner</li>
<li>Behavior: Mom prompts child to ask for a cookie via sign language</li>
<li>Consequence: Mom gives child a cookie</li>
</ol>
<p>Knowing this gives us the option to rearrange antecedents in the future. We can also teach the child&nbsp; how to appropriately ask for a cookie (either through gesture, sign, vocal words or even a talking app).</p>
<p>More on this in the future, but I&rsquo;d like to use the ABC model to help you set up your Happy Ladders activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather than using the Antecedent- Behavior-Consequence for problem behaviors, it can also be used to set up successful learning scenarios.</p>
<p>First, your Antecedent is your set-up, your timing, your goal and the directions you give.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can read our article Setting Your Stage for more on this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Behavior is your child&rsquo;s response. Maybe they say a word, hand you an object or point at a picture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Delivering reinforcement (Consequence) at the right point, and in the right amount after the Behavior is key. The Happy Ladders program was designed to be a play-based approach that capitalizes on your child&rsquo;s interests and natural reinforcement.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a few examples&hellip;</p>
<ol>
<li>Mom sets up an inset puzzle activity, she holds the puzzle pieces, child gets the empty board. (Antecedent)</li>
<li>Child points to their desired piece (PIG). (Behavior)</li>
<li>Mom gives child the puzzle piece to place in the board. She also pairs that with social praise and labels the picture on the puzzle piece at the same time &mdash; &ldquo;Awesome job! PIG!&rdquo; (Consequence)</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do another&hellip;</p>
<ol>
<li>Dad hides around the corner from the child and calls her name. (Antecedent)</li>
<li>She hears her name and crawls to Dad. (Behavior)</li>
<li>Dad says &ldquo;You found me&rdquo; and tickles her before hiding again. (Consequence)</li>
</ol>
<p>So take a shot and see what ya&rsquo; got.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you start teaching your child, look to see how your Happy Ladders activities are set up within the Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you run into behaviors you wish to decrease, you can use the ABC model to help rearrange the Antecedents and Consequences and then provide your child with alternative skills so they learn to obtain reinforcement through more positive behaviors.</p>
