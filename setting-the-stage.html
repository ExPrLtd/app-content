<p class="lead">Four Simple Tips for Success When Teaching Your Child</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making dinner tonight. I&rsquo;m not much of a chef. We eat out way too much, the curse of my husband and I both working outside the home for so many years. As a result, my kitchen skills are lacking. I bought a few cookbooks this year and I&rsquo;m making an effort to cook a home-cooked meal once in a while.</p>
<p>In order to do so, I&rsquo;ve figured out what I need to be successful. I know what I need to Set My Stage. I usually decide on what to make the day before.</p>
<p>This gives me ample time to get to the store the day before or morning of. I also like to have the kitchen clean and dishwasher unloaded. I usually pick a night when I don&rsquo;t have to run a kid to or from a practice so I can work without disruption. Cooking a real meal also takes time, so I need to be able to start early enough so we eat before 8 PM. I also bought an apron and cookbook holder for inspiration.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that if I feel rushed or the kitchen is cluttered, I hurry through the making of the meal and I miss the opportunity to enjoy the process. At that point, some frozen chicken and a bag of broccoli would have been easier. Cooking is a rather creative activity, and creative I am not, so it&rsquo;s taking me some time to relax and learn.</p>
<h2>Clear the Clutter</h2>
<p>Working with kids with developmental needs is very similar. Because some children can struggle to pay attention to relevant stimuli, it is often necessary to limit visual and auditory distractions.</p>
<p>Clearing a family room of other toys and items, maybe even of other people or pets will make it easier for your child to focus on the relevant task; what you are wanting to teach.</p>
<p>Also, pay attention to when they last ate and make sure you have water nearby if they get thirsty. Kids don&rsquo;t do well when hungry and often they don&rsquo;t learn well right after a large meal. You&rsquo;ll have to really monitor your own child&rsquo;s habits here, as everyone is different.</p>
<h2>Find That Golden Hour</h2>
<p>I work best in the morning. My brain seems to start melting after lunch. I do the hard stuff in the morning (with coffee) and the easier stuff in the afternoon. Some kids may operate like me, or maybe the opposite. Maybe they&rsquo;re a bit groggy or grumpy in the morning and come alive in the afternoon. Many parents will also need to work around nap times.</p>
<p>Schedule your play sessions when you have the most energy and headspace (hopefully this coincides with your kiddo&rsquo;s).</p>
<h2>Have a Plan</h2>
<p>Go into your teaching sessions with a plan. Take a second to review what you will do before engaging your child. Get yourself some water or a snack to enjoy while you&rsquo;re playing. Have the toys and items you might need ready to go so you don&rsquo;t have to search for them mid-play session. Most importantly, try and leave your mobile phone a few feet away. If you can, try and be present in the activity.</p>
<p>Easier said than done, I know. Don&rsquo;t get down on yourself if your session doesn&rsquo;t go as planned either. Some days are better than others.</p>
<h2>Keep Em&rsquo; Separated</h2>
<p>Keep toys and activities used for teaching separate from everyday toys. Puzzles, blocks and toys with parts are easy to lose track of. Separating them from everyday toys will ensure they are kept intact and ready to use &mdash; they will maintain their reinforcement value if your child does not have open access to them.</p>
<h2>Setting that Stage</h2>
<p>Setting our stage is not about what we&rsquo;re doing, It&rsquo;s about how we&rsquo;re doing it. Take a few minutes to think through your plan for each session, plan for taking advantage of an optimal time, and create an organized environment that will help both you and your kiddo stay focused on learning.</p>
