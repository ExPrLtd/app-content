<p class="lead">Two of my favorite tools are the concepts of Shaping and Fading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shaping and Fading are baked into so many human actions, and they are especially helpful when teaching children with developmental needs.&nbsp;</p>
<h1>The Official Definition</h1>
<p>Shaping: The production of new behaviors by reinforcing successive approximations of the target behavior</p>
<p>Fading: Decreasing the level of assistance needed to perform a skill or task</p>
<p>A bit technical, so bear with me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shaping and Fading can be a bit of a dance and because humans are not robots, children may need more or less help depending on the day and present antecedents For example, a tired and hungry child is different than working with a child that is awake, fed and ready to learn!</p>
<p>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not a perfect science, but as you start teaching your child and you start to understand what they can do, you will start to see when to push forward (Shaping) and when to pull back (Fading).</p>
<h1>Here are a few examples:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Teaching a child to dress themselves by adding one article of clothing at a time (Shaping)</li>
<li>Decreasing assistance as they become more independent (Fading)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Holding a cup while a child learns to drink (Shaping)</li>
<li>Holding the cup less often as they become more independent (Fading)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Teaching a child to ride a bicycle as they increase their speed (Shaping)</li>
<li>Starting to let go as they become more competent (Fading)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Verbally prompting a child to say &ldquo;coo-kie&rdquo; (Shaping)</li>
<li>Fading those verbal prompts as they start to say more of the word on their own (Fading)</li>
</ul>
<p>You will hear me refer to Shaping and Fading a lot throughout the program, like I said I use them a lot! Don&rsquo;t get discouraged if it takes a while to understand. The strategies will become more clear the more you use them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So give it a shot and see what ya&rsquo; got!</p>
