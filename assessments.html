<p class="lead">Start where they’re at. It seems so simple, right?</p>

<p>Well, maybe not really. Assessing our own children can be hard. For one, we may not be an expert in the material and two, as parents we aren’t always objective. Think of the developmental assessments at the pediatrician’s office. The questions are pretty straightforward and they often provide graphics to help explain.</p>

<p>But even those assessments can be tricky. Maybe your child performs a skill in one environment, but not in any others. Say he might do something at daycare, but not at home…</p>


<p>You may fear not giving them enough credit for all you know they can do, but fear that not relaying where they need help may result in inadequate or inappropriate services.</p>


<h2>So, How Do We Best Assess?</h2>
Let’s go back to those developmental assessments at the doctor’s office. They are usually pretty simple and designed to help catch glaring deficits in a child’s development.


<p>The questions can be simple, like “stands unassisted.” You will know the answer to that one.</p>


<p>“Picks up small items with thumb and index finger,” still pretty simple.</p>


<p>“Uses 5 words regularly.” Hmm, what’s “regularly,” say you’ve only heard a word a few times or maybe you hear it every day, unprompted? Here is where you might be tempted to say yes, but your gut tells you, maybe your child isn’t quite at this stage.
</p>

<p>When taking the Happy Ladders assessments, once you get to these questions that you find are harder to score with a “yes,” score them with a “no.” 
</p>

<p>While assessing in the app, you will say “yes” by clicking the check mark so it turns blue. For a “no,” simply don’t click on the check mark. As your child progresses through their activities, you or the app will check them later!
</p>
<p>It does not change who your child is or what they can do when you don’t check a skill, it just means you are being realistic and choosing to start intervention where they are currently learning and this is so important. 
</p>
<h2>Tips for Assessing Your Child</h2>
<p>Here are a few tips when assessing your child that will help you start where they’re at:
</p>

<p><strong>Be objective.</strong> There is no benefit to giving your child credit for something they don’t yet do. It actually just makes the starting point more difficult.
</p>

<p><strong>Enlist a helper.</strong> Maybe ask another  parent, spouse, aunt, or grandparent to help you do the assessment. Because they know your child, but don’t see them all the time, they may be a better judge of their current skills.
</p>

<p><strong>Don’t worry about partial credit.</strong> It’s either they do a skill easily, regularly and without help, or they don’t.
</p>

<p><strong>Don’t get stuck on your child’s chronological age.</strong> The assessments at the doctor’s office often include age ranges, don’t let that stump or guide you. Focus on the skills, not the age and what you think they should be doing. 
</p>

<p>Remember that success will be more steady and possibly faster if your child starts at an easier point. This will also help create momentum and success for your child, and you, sooner.
</p>

<p>So give it a shot and see what ya’ got!  
</p> 
<p>Remember, you also get one, 30 minute 1:1 consultation via Zoom. This  is a great way to address any assessment questions as you get started!
