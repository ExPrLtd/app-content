<h1>Welcome to Happy Ladders!</h1>
<p>We're delighted you've joined us and can't wait to see what you and your child accomplish through our program!</p>
<p>After you login, you'll see a prompt on the dashboard to take an assessment.</p>
<p>You will find assessments within each of the following skill categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Play</li>
<li>Self-Help</li>
<li>Community &amp; Coping.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure to swipe left in the app to complete all the skills in each assessment. Simply touch the check mark of each skill your child can do and it will turn blue.</p>
<p>The assessments will allow us to recommend the appropriate starting point and activities for your child. It might be best if you actually underestimate what your child can do so the program gives you easier lessons at first and you and your child will catch up quickly to their current skill level.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry if you aren&rsquo;t sure how to answer. See "Assessing Your Child" under Resources for more information.</p>
<p>When you're done, tap the "Create Skill Development Plan" button at the bottom of the screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, you'll be given the option to &ldquo;Add a Caregiver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a great way to keep any other parents, babysitters, grandparents, etc. updated so they also know what they can work on with your child, as well as give them access to training and tips that will help them better support your child and you.</p>
<p>Happy Ladders activities are developmentally sequenced so it&rsquo;s best to go in order, but it's not required to move forward in each skill category. You will have the option to temporarily skip an activity, if desired.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once your child shows mastery of the activity you will select &ldquo;Mark as Mastered.&rdquo; We'll discuss more about what mastery looks like shortly.</p>
<h1>How often should you do Happy Ladders activities with your child?</h1>
<p>Happy Ladders was designed to work for you and your child within your family&rsquo;s structure and routines. So, just do what you can.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideally, 10-30 minutes per day, 4-5 times per week, but if you can only do 10 minutes here and there, a few times a week, that's fine too.</p>
<p>The goal here is small -- but consistent -- effort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much of the program is designed to fit in the time that you already spend with your child, and can be incorporated into your regular routines, such as shopping trips, meal times and nighttime routines.</p>
<p>You will also be prompted to take simple data on you and your child&rsquo;s progress. No worries, we&nbsp;</p>
<p>keep it pretty simple around here.&nbsp; The data you record does helps us to track progress and will also be reported every 6 months to your regional center coordinator. Also, in order to maintain access to the app, you have to use it!</p>
<h1>When is an activity or skill &ldquo;mastered?&rdquo;</h1>
<p>Mastery is the point at which a skill is considered known or learned. The most common measure of mastery is performing a skill 80% of the time, or 8 out of 10 opportunities. It&rsquo;s best to make sure you get this level of response over at least two consecutive days. With some skills, such as crossing the street, you will want to ensure 100% for mastery.</p>
<p>Feel free to use your intuition here, if your child performs an activity or skill easily, move onto the next activity. Also, feel free to revisit previous activities and games, if necessary, or simply because you and your child enjoy them.&nbsp; Also keep in mind, because the activities are functional and often play-based, your implementation should be fluid and will be imperfect.</p>
<p>You will also find the activities and skills within Happy Ladders build on themselves, so no skill is forgotten, only enhanced and built upon in later ladders.</p>
<h1>Getting Help</h1>
<p>If you have questions or comments about an activity, select &ldquo;Post a Question&rdquo; at the bottom of an activity or &ldquo;Join Office Hours&rdquo; to ask your question during a live Office Hours session.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Office Hour sign-ups are also available on the app for set-up, assessment or general questions. These are done in a group format, so you can even just sign-up to hear what other parents are doing and talking about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will also have an opportunity to sign up for one 1:1, 30-minute consultation. We would love to hear about you, your child, and what you are hoping to get from the program, as well as any questions you might have getting started.&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Resources</h1>
<p>In our resources section, you'll find articles, videos and a toy guide. The resources are a great way to augment the activities and learn more about ways to help your child on their journey.&nbsp; You may find that some of the resources will make more sense as you practice the strategies over time.</p>
<h1>Notifications</h1>
<p>Please make sure to turn on your notifications for the app. Notifications will alert you to&nbsp; regular parent training tips and tricks, as well as reminders for weekly Office Hours and most&nbsp; important, praise and encouragement!</p>
<h1>Our Community</h1>
<p>The Happy Ladders community of Parent-Led Revolutionaries was created to ensure you are supported throughout your journey. It is intended to create a safe space for parents to support each other, learn from each other, and share outcomes, tips, and experiences.</p>
<p>It also provides a way for us to help you get the most out of your journey, so please comment and ask questions!</p>
<p>Also, please introduce yourself in the community!&nbsp; If you're comfortable sharing a little about your kiddo, family and where you are in your journey, that's great too!</p>
<p>Wow, that was a lot of information! As you get into the app, it will all make more sense and please reach out whenever you need help!</p>
<p>I hope you are as excited as we are to start Happy Ladders with your child!</p>
<p>So, give it a shot and see what ya got!</p>
